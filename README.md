# Business Activities

## What is BillGo?
-  A bill management and payments platform with over 32MM customers.  
-  Used by thousands of financial instituations. 

### Features
- Bank-agnostic: allows users to pay all of their bills from one app.  
- Allows users to "split" bills, such as rent or utilities. (3)
- Helps users manage all bills and subscriptions - all in one place.  Automatically pulls the most important bill statment information into a calendar or list.

### Competitors
- Direct:  Doxo - 7MM customers.  Offers identity, late fee, credit, and overdraft protection for a small monthly fee. 
- Direct:  Traditional and online banks.  These instituations offer bill pay however the unique feature of BillGo is that it consolidates all bills and allows and users to pay from any account they have set up, from credit card to bank account.
- Indirect:  Many of the bill payment solution providers focus on the business community, as opposed to BillGo which focuses on the consumer. 
- Overall:  The biggest competitive advantage BillGo has currently is the market share.  Once they have users on their platform they tend to stay more long-term.  As long as they keep updating their product (and they've had a major usability issue recently that had to be fixed), they will retain their customer base.

# Landscape
## FinTech Domain  
- Payments 
## Trends and Innovation
- Digitisation and Cashless:  "The financial services industry is in the midst of a significant transformation, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. And given the key role digitisation plays in the financial lives of more and more of the world’s population, electronic payments are at the epicentre of this transformation. Payments are becoming increasingly cashless, and the industry’s role in fostering inclusion has become a significant priority. Payments also are supporting the development of digital economies and are driving innovation — all while functioning as a stable backbone for our economies."  https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/publications/financial-services-in-2025/payments-in-2025.html
- Real-time:  Payments are being made more and more in real-time.  "Most payments still take days. Real-time payments jumped 41% in 2020 to 70.3 billion transactions globally. But that's less than a tenth of the world's payments, according to a report by ACI Worldwide. The top real-time markets globally were India (25.5 billion transactions), China (15.7 billion) and South Korea (6 billion). The U.S. is shockingly behind, with only 1.2 billion transactions. ACI counted more than 50 instant payment methods worldwide, with more on the way". https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/real-time-payments-growth?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1
- Peer-to-peer:  Solutions like Zelle and Venmo allow users to send money directly, in real-time, to each other, through a linked bank account or card.
- Reshaping the front and back-end payments eco-system:  "That reshaping involves two parallel trends: an evolution of the front- and back-end parts of the payment system (instant payments; bill payments and request to pay; and plastic cards and digital wallets); and a revolution involving huge structural changes to the payment mix and ecosystem (emergence of so-called “buy now, pay later” offerings; cryptocurrencies; and work underway on central bank digital currencies)".    https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/financial-services/publications/financial-services-in-2025/payments-in-2025.html
- Allowing employees access to daily payments for work completed: "Today, fintech startup Even is setting a new trend with support from J.P. Morgan, the U.S. banking powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over $496 billion. The company has revealed JP Morgan is enabling real time payments (RTP) for it. With this new feature, Even is planning to be one of the first businesses in the world to provide millions of hourly workers across the United States immediate access to their earned salaries. Until now, this option has only been available to people working for online platforms such as ride-hailing apps".  https://fintechmagazine.com/digital-payments/jp-morgan-enables-fintech-firm-even-real-time-payments

# Results
## Business Impact of BillGo
- With 32MM end users and thousands of financial institutions supporting BillGo solutions, the impact has been huge. They have helped their customers pay their bills on-time, provided better visibility into the bills, and helped thousands of financial institutions to collect on bills that may have otherwise been delinquent.
- One of the core metrics for end-user payment solutions is the number of customers using their application and how often they are using it.  BillGo has a great model in that 32MM customers user the product and they are motivated to use the application with great predictability - when a bill is due, the uesr needs to use the app to pay the bill.
- BillGo is the leading solution in this particular Payments niche.  Their closest competitor has roughly 20 percent of the customer base.

# Recommendations
## What products and services would I recommend BillGo offer?
- Peer-to-peer payment solution.  BillGo's users are already used to paying bills and splitting bills, they just need the ability to pay the bill to a peer, instead of an institution.
- Consumer payment transactions - Like paying at Starbucks or McDonald's
- They could move into the buy now - pay later niche, however it would require adding the lending expertise to the existing team.  This would be a longer-term solution but could add a new revenue stream to the company. 
- Overall, given the user base, BillGo could easily move into many other solutions that are end-user customer centric.  They simply need to create solutions that look and feel like their existing solutions and they won't need to start from ground zero like many of the new FinTech entrants.  
- Technologies:  "Technologies that make these digital payment services possible involve machine learning and artificial intelligence. As consumers continue making purchases with their cards, mobile wallets, or applications, machine learning technology is able to study these experiences and improve them over time. This improved experience ensures greater fraud protection and security. Additionally, contactless digital payments rely on NFC and magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology. NFC technology enables a connection between two electronic devices over a small distance. It enables consumers to pay with their mobile wallets via tablets, smartphones, or smartwatches. Comparatively, MST technology uses a magnetic signal from the mobile device to a card reader—because it emulates a magnetic stripe like one found on a credit or debit card, MST tech is compatible with most payment processors". https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/digital-payment-services/
- Other technologies:  Open banking APIs, Biometric Verification, and Blockchain
